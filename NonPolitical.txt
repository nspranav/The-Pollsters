“In my life, the biggest hurdle I’ve had to overcome has been to just love myself. You can’t be good to anybody if you’re not good to yourself first.” —drag artist and performer @SheaCoulee https://t.co/AFnusOoiSz https://t.co/FvckUCTodN

We want to create a safe and supportive community for everyone on Instagram. For even more tips, visit: https://t.co/Vgco7yma5R
To give you more control over who can contact you on Instagram, there’s a new way to limit who can send you direct messages. The feature lets only the people you follow message you and add you to group threads. https://t.co/UyhOpcCAZG
We also want to help stop bullying before it happens. If someone writes a potentially offensive comment or caption, they’ll get a prompt saying it’s similar to content that’s been reported for bullying. We’ve found this can encourage people to reconsider what they’re posting.
ICYMI, we’ve also been rolling out more features to help prevent bullying. When you restrict an account, only they can see their comments on your posts. And they can’t see when you’ve read their direct messages or when you’re active on Instagram. https://t.co/dOBhxFAITO
If your account’s been disabled, there’s a new way to appeal in the app. When you try to log in, you’ll see an option to “Request a Review.” Tap it and we’ll review your disabled account and potentially restore it. We'll roll out these features over the coming weeks. https://t.co/W9r6B7dpau
You can also tap “More Options” for suggested actions – like muting, blocking or unfollowing accounts you’ve reported. And if you disagree with our decision on the content, you can request a review and we’ll take a second look.
Now when you report something that shouldn’t be on Instagram (like bullying or offensive content), you can get updates through Support Requests. It’s a new feature in the app that shows you the status of your reports. Go to “Settings”  –&gt; “Support Requests.” https://t.co/6hag2ccKtx
For #SaferInternetDay, we’re sharing some tips on how to stay safe on Instagram and take more control over your experience❤️

We have not made any recent changes to feed ranking, and we never hide posts from people you're following – if you keep scrolling, you will see them all. Again, your feed is personalized to you and evolves over time based on how you use Instagram.✌️
What shows up first in your feed is determined by what posts and accounts you engage with the most, as well as other contributing factors such as the timeliness of posts, how often you use Instagram, how many people you follow, etc.
We’ve noticed an uptick in posts about Instagram limiting the reach of your photos to 7% of your followers, and would love to clear this up.
